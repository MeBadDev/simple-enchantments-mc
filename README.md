My first ever Minecraft mod for the Hackclub's Hackcraft YSWS Edition.


This mod adds 5 tool enchantments:

* Lumberjack (Axe): Break one log, and the whole tree falls. 
* Vein Miner (Pickaxe): Mines all connected ores of the same type at once.
* Skybound (Boots, treasure enchantment): Lets the player jump again while in the air. Reduces 80% of the fall damages
* Magnet (Chestplate): Pulls nearby dropped items toward you.
* Swift Swim (Leggings): Moves at dolphin speed underwater without needing Depth Strider.
